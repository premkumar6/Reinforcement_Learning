This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from OpenAI Gym. Advanced techniques use Tensorflow for neural network implementations.
